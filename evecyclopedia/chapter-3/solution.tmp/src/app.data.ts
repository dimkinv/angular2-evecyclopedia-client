It combines powerful laser systems with overwhelming weapon disruption at close ranges, designed to meet the realities of capsuleer combat in the contested low security regions where the Empire's borders are in most need of bolstering.","volume":28100,"capacity":165,"mass":1064000,"market_group_description":"Navy faction frigate designs.","meta_group_name":"Faction","attributes":[{"description":"current damage dealt to module","icon_path":"22_32_10.png","value":0},{"description":"The maximum hitpoints of an object.","icon_path":"2_64_9.png","value":525},{"description":"power output of power core","icon_path":"2_64_7.png","value":42},{"description":"The number of low power slots on the ship.","icon_path":"8_64_9.png","value":3},{"description":"tbd","icon_path":"8_64_10.png","value":4},{"description":"tbd","icon_path":"8_64_11.png","value":3},{"description":"Current load of power core","icon_path":"2_64_7.png","value":0},{"description":"Maximum velocity of ship","icon_path":"22_32_13.png","value":340},{"description":"CPU output of ship","icon_path":"12_64_7.png","value":160},{"description":"CPU load of ship","icon_path":"12_64_7.png","value":0},{"description":"Amount of time taken to fully recharge the capacitor.","icon_path":"22_32_16.png","value":250000},{"description":"The agility of the object.","icon_path":"22_32_24.png","value":3.35},{"description":"Maximum range at which the scanner can lock a target.","icon_path":"22_32_15.png","value":64000},{"description":"scanning speed in milliseconds","icon_path":"3_64_9.png","value":2000},{"description":"The number of remaining unused launcher slots.","icon_path":"12_64_12.png","value":0},{"description":"Remaining number of unused turret slots on the ship.","icon_path":"12_64_9.png","value":2},{"description":"damage multiplier vs. kinetic damagers.","icon_path":"22_32_17.png","value":0.67},{"description":"damage multiplier vs. thermal.","icon_path":"22_32_18.png","value":0.67},{"description":"damage multiplier vs. explosive damagers.","icon_path":"22_32_19.png","value":0.67},{"description":"Electro magnetic damage multiplier for shield and armor.

With the Kirin, their aim was to continue pushing forward the development of cutting-edge defense optimization systems while providing powerful and mobile support capability.","volume":20000,"capacity":270,"mass":1480000,"market_group_description":"Caldari Logistics Frigates","meta_group_name":"Tech II","attributes":[{"description":"current damage dealt to module","icon_path":"22_32_10.png","value":0},{"description":"The maximum hitpoints of an object.","icon_path":"2_64_9.png","value":375},{"description":"power output of power core","icon_path":"2_64_7.png","value":42},{"description":"The number of low power slots on the ship.","icon_path":"8_64_9.png","value":2},{"description":"tbd","icon_path":"8_64_10.png","value":5},{"description":"tbd","icon_path":"8_64_11.png","value":3},{"description":"Current load of power core","icon_path":"2_64_7.png","value":0},{"description":"Maximum velocity of ship","icon_path":"22_32_13.png","value":370},{"description":"CPU output of ship","icon_path":"12_64_7.png","value":215},{"description":"CPU load of ship","icon_path":"12_64_7.png","value":0},{"description":"Amount of time taken to fully recharge the capacitor.","icon_path":"22_32_16.png","value":307500},{"description":"The agility of the object.","icon_path":"22_32_24.png","value":3.95},{"description":"Maximum range at which the scanner can lock a target.","icon_path":"22_32_15.png","value":50000},{"description":"scanning speed in milliseconds","icon_path":"3_64_9.png","value":6000},{"description":"The number of remaining unused launcher slots.","icon_path":"12_64_12.png","value":2},{"description":"Remaining number of unused turret slots on the ship.","icon_path":"12_64_9.png","value":2},{"description":"damage multiplier vs. kinetic damagers.","icon_path":"22_32_17.png","value":0.67},{"description":"damage multiplier vs. thermal.","icon_path":"22_32_18.png","value":0.67},{"description":"damage multiplier vs. explosive damagers.","icon_path":"22_32_19.png","value":0.67},{"description":"Electro magnetic damage multiplier for shield and armor.
